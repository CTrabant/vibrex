# End of experiment

This was an experiment with two goals:
- try out vibe coding where I am only concerned with the tests and results
- create a regex engine faster than PCRE2 for a limited feature set

Conclusions:

1) Vibe coding was fun!  Also, the LLMs are good at combining information but
   quite far from independent code generators.  None of the leading engines
   (available as of June 2025) created initial examples that would even compile.
   But following iterative prompts and guidance would create code that is clever
   and functional.  Highlights were reviews for security and for robustness, and
   speed; the machines can understand and modify code much faster than (most)
   humans. A basic regex engine can be generated by these LLMs but not one
   better than existing optimized engines.  Also you cannot count on anything
   outside of test cases working.

2) With a limited feature set I ended up with code that was faster that PCRE2 in
   many benchmarks for the general engine.  But I could get no where close to the
   PCRE2's JIT-enabled matching.

# vibrex

A high-performance regex engine by machines for machines in portable C, designed
for speed for a limited subset of regular expression features.

This engine was written by LLMs with guidance regarding features, optimizations,
and test review from a human, who didn't bother to look at the actual code.

## Features
- ASCII and extended ASCII support only
- Fast alternation and matching
- Supported regex metacharacters:
  - `.`    - Any single character
  - `*`    - Zero or more of the preceding atom
  - `+`    - One or more of the preceding atom
  - `?`    - Zero or one of the preceding atom
  - `^`    - Anchor to the start of the string
  - `$`    - Anchor to the end of the string
  - `|`    - Alternation (logical OR)
  - `\`    - Escape for regex metacharacters
  - `()`   - Group syntax (no capturing), including support for:
    - `()?`  - Optional groups
  - `[]`   - Character class, including support for:
    - `[a-z]`  - Character class range
    - `[^abc]` - Negated character class
    - `[a-z]?` - Optional character class
- No external dependencies
- Public domain (CC0 1.0 Universal)

## Build
To build the library, demo, and test programs:

```
make           # builds the static library libvibrex.a and command line tool
make test      # builds and runs vibrex-test
make benchark  # Builds and runs vibrex-benchmark for testing against PCRE2, system regex
make compare   # builds vibrex-compare for bulk comparison testing
```

## Usage example
Here's a minimal example of compiling a pattern, matching a string, and freeing the pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "vibrex.h"

int main(void)
{
    const char *compile_error = NULL;

    vibrex_t *pattern = vibrex_compile("h.llo", &compile_error);
    if (!pattern)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "Failed to compile pattern: %s\n", (compile_error) ? compile_error : "Unknown");
      return 1;
    }

    const char *text = "hello";
    if (vibrex_match(pattern, text))
    {
      printf("'%s' matches!\n", text);
    }
    else
    {
      printf("'%s' does not match.\n", text);
    }

    vibrex_free(pattern);

    return 0;
}
```

## Command line tool
The vibrex-cli program can be used to test a pattern against a string:

```console
./vibrex-cli 'la.* dog$' 'happy but lazy dog'
Pattern:  "la.* dog$"
Text:     "happy but lazy dog"
Status:   Matched
Time:     0.000001 seconds
```

## Benchmark tool
The vibrex-benchmark program can be used to perform performance tests
of various patterns against vibrex, [PCRE2](https://www.pcre.org/), and
the system's regex (POSIX) implementation.

A benchmark run with 1000000 iterations per test:
```console
./vibrex-benchmark 1000000
Running benchmarks with 1000000 iterations per test.
